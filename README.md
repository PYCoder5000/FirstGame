# Game Description
This is my first Unity project. It is a physics simulator. You press the shapes to select them. Press right mouse button to spawn selected block. Use WASD to move the camera. Click and drag blocks to make them fly.
# Code Location
All of the important code is in the Assets/Scripts folder.
